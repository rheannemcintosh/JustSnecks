# JustSnecks :avocado::croissant::tomato:

## Project Overview
JustSnecks is a basic Laravel 8 restaurant application which displays food and their categories. The application is based off of a Udemy Tutorial by Ranjeet Karki which can be accessed [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-masterclass-build-web-apps-with-laravel-7-php). Although I am familiar with building laravel applications for work, I decided to embark on this Udemy course to further my skills and learn some new ways of doing things! This is also a part of my 2<sup>nd</sup> round of **100 Days of Code**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the Udemy tutorial, with some small edits along the way. This consisted of 8 Pull Requests, which took me 6 days.
- [#1 - Add Laravel UI and User Authentication](https://github.com/rheannemcintosh/justsnecks/pull/1) 
- [#2 - Fix a recurring MySQL Error](https://github.com/rheannemcintosh/justsnecks/pull/2) 
- [#3 - Create the Models and Migrations](https://github.com/rheannemcintosh/justsnecks/pull/3)
